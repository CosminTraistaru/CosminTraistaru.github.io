A few years ago I bought this domain and used it only for mail and since then
I wanted to start a blog,  but I did not know what to write on it.
Now I convinced myself to create it.
But I wanted to be fast, I like fast things.

What could I do?

- Start a wordpress blog just like everybody else? NO! To many shady plugins that 
I do not understand that they do (php is not something I want to learn)
- Build a [Jekyll][jekyll] blog on [Github Pages][github-pages]. Sure! All you need know is some html.

Is it fast?

- All static pages that are hosted on Github CDN, so yes, it should be.

50% of all web page views are done from mobile pages, what could I do?

- [Google AMP Pages][google-amp], Google's answer to instant page loading when searching content online

This took some time, I left the base Jekyll theme and started to modify it
to be AMP ready. Basically most html tags are changed with amp-html tags,
and after this google caches your amp pages on it's CDNs and serves the pages from
there.

Now all the recommendations are that your site is secure, https:

- Googled it a little and found [Kloudsec][kloudsec], free https for custom domain Github Pages

The result:

- A secure blog that loads in about 1 sec, the first load.
