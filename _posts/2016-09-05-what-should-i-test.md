These are my go to questions when I get to overwhelmed about what to
test to a feature/bug that is not well documented.

- What does the feature/bug should do?

- What does the implementation/fix impacts?

- Who uses this feature?

- On what browser/system should it work?

I am sure that every tester out there has it's own set of questions, 
or actions he/she prefers to do.
