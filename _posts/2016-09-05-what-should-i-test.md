These are my go to questions when I get too overwhelmed about what to
test for a feature/bug that is not well documented.

- What should the feature/bug do?

- What impact does the implementation/fix has on the product?

- Who uses this feature?

- On what browser/system should it work?

I am sure that every tester out there has it's own set of questions, 
or actions he/she prefers to do.
